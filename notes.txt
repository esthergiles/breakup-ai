I left off on 8-14 with the submit button not working on the code from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRl5jd77mv4

I asked chatgpt to write some code and it told me to use a component level design instead of creating a server evt

next approach:
ditch the server, try developing it to just be on a component? maybe?
