 ## Spin it up

1. Download and Extract the ZIP:
   * Download the provided ZIP file to your computer.
   * Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to a location of your choice.

2. Replace OpenAPI Key:
   * Open the extracted folder in your preferred code editor.
   * Locate the .env file in the project root directory.
   * Inside the .env file, find the line with OPENAPI_KEY=YOUR_OPENAPI_KEY.
   * Replace YOUR_OPENAPI_KEY with your actual OpenAPI key obtained from the OpenAI platform.

3. Check Node Installation:
   * Open a command terminal on your computer.
   * Type node -v and press Enter.
   * If you see a version number displayed, it means Node.js is installed. If not, you'll need to install Node.js from the official [website](https://nodejs.org/).

4. Run the Node Server:
   * In your command terminal, navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files using the cd command.
   * Once you're inside the project folder, type node server.js and press Enter.
   * You should see a message that says "Server is running on port 8020."
   * DO NOT CLOSE THIS TERMINAL
5. Launch the React App:
   * Open a new (second) command terminal.
   * Navigate to the same project folder using the cd command, if you're not already there.
   * Enter the command npm start and press Enter.
   * Your default web browser should open, and you'll be directed to http://localhost:3000.

** Remember to replace YOUR_OPENAPI_KEY with your actual OpenAPI key and ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you encounter any issues, double-check the steps, and refer to the official documentation or error messages for troubleshooting.

Note: These instructions are intended to be a general guide. The specific steps might vary slightly based on your operating system and setup.
